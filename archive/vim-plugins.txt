The following is a list of the vim plugins that my vim config depends on.
Hunt these down on github, and clone them into the directory `~/.vim/bundle/`.
As long as you have the file `~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim` in place,
the plugins will be loaded by the vimrc automatically.

ctrlp.vim
indentLine
LargeFile
vim-airline
vim-airline-themes
vim-fugitive
vim-json
vim-startify
vim-visual-increment
